## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Player launches the game and is prompted to **Start** or **Exit**.
2. If started, a **3x3 game board** is initialized with empty cells.
3. Players take turns:
   - **Player O** goes first on odd-numbered turns.
   - **Player X** goes second on even-numbered turns.
4. Players input row and column numbers (0â€“2) to place their symbol (`O` or `X`).
5. The board is updated and displayed after each valid move.
6. The game checks for a **win condition** after every turn.
7. The game ends if a player wins or the board is full (tie logic can be added).
